"""The swe-day run lock, and the one state machine behind it.

The lock is one directory inside the repository holding one metadata
file. This program owns the phase model and is the only thing that
decides which human gate is pending; ``swe_day_next.py`` only renders
what it reports.

State is three facts: the phase last recorded, the gates cleared so
far, and who holds the lock. Everything else is derived:

- the recorded phase's own gate is pending until ``clear-gate`` clears
  it;
- otherwise, when the next phase is human-owned, that phase's gate is
  pending, and clearing it moves the run into the phase;
- otherwise the next phase is the agent's.

``set-phase`` never moves backward, never advances past a pending gate,
and never enters a human-owned phase. ``release`` refuses while a gate
is pending unless the operator passes ``--abandon``.

These rules hold within one held lock. ``acquire --phase`` starts a new
run at any phase with no gates cleared, so releasing and acquiring again
is a way around a gate that this program does not police.

The lock is advisory. It coordinates callers that use this program; it
is not a security boundary against a caller that edits the directory
directly. Changes are serialized with ``flock`` on the lock's parent,
so the program needs ``fcntl`` and does not run where that is missing.

Exit codes: 0 done (``status`` for any valid path, and ``release`` when
there is no lock), 2 a usage error or, from ``acquire``, ``set-phase`` and
``clear-gate``, a lock that already exists or is not held, 3 the caller
does not own the lock, 4 a phase or gate refusal, 5 the lock path leaves
the repository, is a symbolic link, cannot be resolved, has a parent
that cannot be created, or sits inside another readable lock, or
``--repo`` is not a directory, 6 the lock's contents are
missing, unusable or unexpected, or the filesystem refused an operation.
